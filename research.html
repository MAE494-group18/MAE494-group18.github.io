									<h3>Types of Wind Turbines - Found by Gina</h3>
									<p>In the paper titled “Types of Wind Turbines” it discusses the two main types of wind turbines: Horizontal axis wind turbines, called HAWT’s, and vertical axis wind turbines, called VAWT’s <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[1]</a>. When describing HAWT’s, which is the type of turbine we are basing our project off of, I focused on the typical design layout as well as the different aspects that HAWT’s are comprised of. For instance, the common design for HAWT’s are a large rotor comprising two, three, or four blades mounted on a horizontal shaft at the top of the tower <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[1]</a>. However, these types of turbines generate noise, which is one of the largest disadvantages of HAWT’s <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[1]</a>. From this article, we can understand that one of the most important aspects we should focus on fixing is the noise levels because if the noise levels decrease then the chance for sales would increase.
									A specific type of HAWT is a stalled-controlled wind turbine where the pitch is fixed at a certain angle on the hub <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[1]</a>. Since this type of HAWT draws low efficiency <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[1]</a>, this emphasizes the main goal of our project to design an active twist turbine blade so it can still collect wind energy at low wind speed. However, the journal brings up a large issue where even though it solves the disadvantages that stalled-controlled wind turbines encounter, the active twist turbine also adds extra complexity and cost <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[1]</a>.
									The article also discusses the use of variable-speed generator. Using a variable-speed generator reduces the mechanical stresses on the gearbox to increase the overall efficiency of the wind turbine <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[1]</a>. If we could apply this into our design, it will enable us to tackle another disadvantage found in HAWT’s: frequent repairs. Since there is less stress on the generator, the generator would be able to last longer. However, my project group would have to weigh out the cost of the variable-speed generator to the benefits it could provide before we would decide to use it.

									<h3>Power Generation Technologies - Found by Clara</h3>
									<p>For the journal document a chapter from Paul Breeze’s book, Power Generation Technologies (2nd Edition), was chosen. This chapter covers wind energy generation. This is important as a starting point in the design of the blade because the main goal is to maximize the energy obtained by the wing with the active twist. The article describes that the majority of the wind energy generated was from onshore wind farms, but the market for offshore win energy harvesting is growing. During the initial stages of the design process we focused on the requirements for the blade that would come about from the environment it was in. Since these blades will be in extremely harsh environment (high winds, low temperature, sky debris and birds) and therefore, more so than basic turbine blades, our wings will require a much higher degree of durability. Since each segment will be affected individually but also as the blade as whole, we will need to account for ways to minimize stress from external threats. Though much of the control system can be located in the nacelle at the top of the tower, there will be many vital sensors and rotary motors within the blade that must be kept protected. This journal is an important starting step to understand the internal mechanisms for energy generation for the turbine. It is important not only that the sections are able to perform the active twist, but also that this new function will not disrupt the main shaft to generator system that actually collects the energy. The journal states that one of the most difficult aspects of the design of an effective generator is the varying wind conditions, some systems even use two generators, one for high speeds and one for low speeds. Most likely in actuality the active twist wind turbine blades will require variable-speed generator, but these are a much newer technology and the more flexible they become the more expensive they are to implement. </p>
									<h3>Protective Coatings for Turbine Blades - Found by Josh</h3>
									<p>The introduction of the book discusses how coatings can be used in order to improve the life of a turbine blade. Many turbine blades suffer from surface damage that causes the turbine blade to need constant repairs. The two main surface issues that turbine blades face are oxidation and corrosion <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[3]</a>. This is due to the turbine blade living in difficult outdoor environmental conditions. Utilizing different coatings will combat the corrosion and oxidation that occurs to the turbine blade. The coating material can be resistant to these problems and help expand the life of the turbine blade. Utilizing diffusion coating, materials such as Ni-Al and Ni3Al have become widely used. <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[3]</a> These coatings do not however allow deliberate changes to their properties in order to fulfill the requirement of the blade. <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[3]</a> The textbook introduction goes into further detail discussing different coatings that can be used and how it can be applied.
									This journal is useful to our project because it is an idea that we can use to make our turbine blade better. With the list of coatings that the book gives, a proper coating can be used to help improve the quality of life of our invention. The book also brings up a point that the material that is used for the turbine blade should be one that can survive the outdoor conditions. This means that material consideration is an important component of the turbine blade design. A coating can easily be applied during the manufacturing process. Applying this crucial step can make the turbine blade a competitive product and have a longer lifespan than most other blades.

									<h3>Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Turbomachinery - Found by Matt</h3>
									<p>This text describes the common control methods used in wind turbines to start the turbine from rest, regulate the power while the turbine is operating, and stopping the turbine if and when wind speed becomes excessive.  The startup of most large wind turbines is done by using the generator as a motor until the initial resistive torque is surpassed.  One method of control is adjusting the pitch of the rotor blades.  This can be used to tune the blades to the current wind speed. It can also be used as a built in brake to slow the blades when wind speeds are too high for safe operation.  Another method of control is called passive or stall control.  This involves varying the aerodynamic profile along the length of the blade such that at exceedingly high wind speeds the blades exhibit a self-braking characteristic.  This has the benefit of not requiring powered actuation, however, does result in a decrease in power output at high wind speeds.  Another option is aileron control.  This involves the use of aerodynamic control surfaces to produce a braking effect.  For larger blades this can be preferable to pitch control, which requires larger bearings and actuators, thus reducing weight.  These control surfaces deflect upwards to reduce lift. The active twist angle control that our project hopes to achieve has similar characteristics to the stall and pitch control methods in this text.  It will use aerodynamic stall to achieve the braking necessary to save the turbine in excessive wind speed, but allows for better power output at high wind speeds as the amount of twist can be controlled for specific wind speeds.</P>
									<h3>Study of the Textile Composite Adaptive Blade of Small Wind Turbine - Found by Mark</h3>
									<p>This journal report covers the use of composite blades that are slightly adaptive and appropriately deformable in various wind conditions. The purpose of this adaptiveness is to further utilize various wind currents and extend the lifespan of the blades. The lifespans are extended because of the material strength of these blades as well as the intentional dispersion of mechanical energy into vibration rather than resisting these vibrations. This turbine set up also can stop itself when a certain wind speed is detected. Although active controls and lightweight composite materials are useful for our project, the test size blades were much smaller than typically used by modern wind farm scale wind turbines. Our initial design concept utilizes blade segments, which are much closer in size to these tested composite blades. These blade segments are potentially vulnerable to similar vibration characteristics, so the analysis done in this paper is useful for us to avoid any deformations and reductions in turbine blade lifespan. A similar FEA set up could be used to determine any stresses on the blade and blade segments, as well as determine the consequences of using blade segments instead of a continuous blade. The high wind speed stresses used in this paper are useful in the sense that we have a rough estimate of the loading profile we can expect on the blades. This paper primarily covers the qualities of the composite materials used, which are similar to most wind turbine blades. One of our thoughts from the previous class was to not use as rigid segments, but if we decide to utilize rigid segments then this paper is much more useful to us.</p>
									<h3>Blade of a Wind Turbine - Found by Gina</h3>
									<p>A crucial concept to understand when designing an active twist blade is the shape of the turbine blade and how it interacts with the rest of the system. The patent discusses the various ways that the blade connects to the hub, which is critical to the function of the blade, how the blade is made, and what materials should be utilized <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[6]</a>. The patent also talks about the way that the forces act on the blade and how it can be utilized for the efficiency of the turbine <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[6]</a>. The patent demonstrates that the blade component is coupled with the rotor strength as well as describes how the flow of air passes over the turbine blade and the type of flow that comes off the blade when the air passes over it <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[6]</a>. Included within the patent are various drawings that outline how the blade connects to the main hub of the turbine.
            			Understanding the shape of the turbine blade shows how the active twist angle plays into the efficiency. The turbine blade shape is already efficient, so the creation of the active twist blade would have to be similar in shape. Knowing the shape allows us to know the best locations to place sensors and what sections could potentially be movable. The patent is also relevant because it informs us of the different materials we can use in order to make our active twist blade. Utilizing the shape of the blade also shows the different ways that the active twist blade will have to be manufactured.

									<h3>Wind Turbine Having Sensor Elements Mounted on Rotor Blades - Found by Clara</h3>
									<p>The patent chosen was US 6,940,186 B2, which patents the idea of wind turbines having sensor elements mounted on their rotor blades. This is essential, because the wind turbine blade we are in the process of designing will most likely require sensing devices within the blade. These sensing devices could include, but are not limited to accelerometers to sense the speed of the blade, wind speed sensors, so that the internal twist system knows how to respond and turn the blade, and strain gauges to ensure that the levels of stress along the wing do not reach dangerous levels. The benefits of having these sensors on the blades is that it allows computer controller to determine characteristics of flow and react accordingly. The disadvantages of this are that it uses power generated to acquire and process data, does not control the blade (which will require a separate control surface and system), and it increases the complexity of the blade and the system. Although the patent does not describe the power draw of the control system, it is likely that this could be minimized. The primary power draw would be the actuation of twisting in the blade, which is not described in this patent. The patent relates to wind power plants, specifically turbines that consist of a tower and at least one rotor blade. The patent is specific to sensors associated with the rotor which would generate signals depending on the mechanical load of the rotor and the data-processing means for determining evaluation signals that describe the loads on the blade.

									<h3>Wind Turbine Rotor Aileron - Found by Josh</h3>
									<p>This patent allows maneuverability of the turbine blade. Ailerons on the turbine blade can allow the change in twist angle, which can improve the efficiency of the turbine blade. Replicating the movement of an airplane wing in order to change how the wing is shaped, the leading edge of the aileron allows the air to vent if the position is outside the range <a href="#references" class="scrolly">[8]</a>. Monitoring the wind and performing some calculations will allow for proper adjustment of the aileron to a certain position if the wind exceeds a predetermined speed. The ailerons help with stop the motion of the turbine blade when the turbine is not in use. Placing the actuator within the turbine blade makes it heavier, so it is crucial that the twist angle makes up for the loss in efficiency due to the increased weight. A computer controller could be linked with the control of the actuator and to change the effective camber of the turbine blades. The increased complexity of the turbine blade is a drawback to this invention. With the increase in subassemblies and the amount of excess parts utilized, manufacturing the turbine blade becomes tedious and difficult.
									This patent is relevant because it is a good baseline of how to change the twist angle of a turbine blade. Understanding this invention shows what type of components come into play and how the different assemblies will interact while the turbine blade is rotating. The patent demonstrates how to monitor when the twist angle should be adjusted, and what circumstances that provide maximum efficiency.</p>
									<h3>Fixed geometry self-starting transverse axis wind turbine - Found by Matt</h3>
									<p>This patent describes the design of a wind turbine blade designed for a vertical axis wind turbine.  The design involves the selection of an airfoil that is outside of the standard thickness to chord length ratio for vertical axis wind turbines. This gives the blades better starting characteristics, as well as increases torque in intermediate and high speed ranges.  This patent also describes the methodology of using two blades in the invention.  This is because as more blades are added they are affected more so by the trailing wake of the other blades. Also, a single bladed vertical axis turbine will have difficulty during startup. The shape of the airfoil used in this invention is critical. Its cambered shape contributes to a better startup as the flow separates from the inner convex surface of the downstream facing blade. This results in a high drag force, which in this application provides the desired forward rotation. This cambered airfoil shape also results in low drag at intermediate to high speeds, where the upstream facing blade will be encountering a curved flow stream. One benefit to the vertical axis (transverse) wind turbine is that turning the wind turbine to face the wind stream is not necessary.  The turbine can start from any orientation of the two blades to the wind stream.  Variations in the flow stream are enough to cause small rotational oscillations when the blades are perpendicular to the flow, thus allowing the turbine to start.  This patent could help us to choose an airfoil shape that will provide significant lift without generating too much drag.

									<h3>Rotor Pitch Control Method and Apparatus for Parking Wind Turbine - Found by Mark</h3>
									<p>This patent covers methods for limited control of a wind turbine blade and the rotational speed of the turbine overall. The patent of course references some prior art and attempts to control the rotation of the wind turbine. The goal of this patent and the prior art is to allow for a safe reduction in rotational speed as well as the ability to “park” a blade in instances of severe weather and high winds. Without the ability to reduce rotational speed of a turbine, it is entirely possible to damage the turbine from overheating. Conditions with high winds can also apply intense structural loadings to the blades and therefore reduce the lifespan of the blades. The patent achieves these goals by including a control system and actuators to control the pitch of the wind turbine blades. Weather forecast information would be used to inform the wind turbines to place themselves in the parking configuration and wait out the severe conditions. This patent is useful in the development of the active twist turbine as the controls and sensor input have already been denoted. While it may be useful to use weather forecast information to do an advanced shut down of the turbines, it is just as useful to only use the live sensor data from the turbine blade mounts to determine the wind speed and decide to shut down the turbine. The patent is also in the public domain, despite being granted in 2002, as the maintenance fees for the patent were not payed. Therefore any further development of this technology does not require the licensing of this patent.
